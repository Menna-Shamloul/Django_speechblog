# **Speech Blog**
The idea behind Speech Blog is simple: you can do wonders for your child when you have the right mix of data and support.I learned this first hand when my daughter's speech and language wasn't developing as expected.After working with speech language pathologists, I realized how important it is for us to have access to information,expertise and encourgement that puts parents first.
With this idea, I created"Speech Blog"it is blog for parents to exhange ideas and informations to handle speech delay issue.
